1. Before the print start, the bed and nozzle are heated to the temp specify in cura for the piece that you want print.
2. Then the autoleveling of bed begin, but because the nozzle are heated to the temperature specify in cura, the filament begins to come out of the nozzle (as threads) with the nozzle movements in this process.

For this reason is because before the auteleveling start I cool the noozle to 140 degrees.
Before the print start to draw the first line, I heated the noozle with the temperature specify in cura to start printing the piece.
